## What is Ketamine?
- Rapidly acting nonbarbiturate drug used for general anesthetic providing a dissociative effect and sedation. It can also lead to hallucinations.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Ketamine acts in a noncompetitive antagonistic mechanism of the NMDA receptor, thereby inhibiting excitation producing a net inhibitory effect 
- It also has secondary effects at the opiate, muscarinic, cholinergic and serotonergic receptors 
- Ketamine is a highly lipid soluble drug and is metabolized in the liver via demethylation and hydroxylation pathways. It is eliminated via the gastrointestinal tract and renal system in its metabolite forms.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] [^3]
#### Cardiovascular 
- Ketamine inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This manifests as a transient increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance therefore increasing cardiac output. 
- It also increases coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen demand. 

#### Respiratory
- There is minimal effect of ketamine on respiratory drive, minute ventilation is preserved along with airway reflexes however large induction doses can lead to loss of airway reflexes. 
- Ketamine can produce airway relaxation with action on inflammatory cascades and bronchial smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation 
- Increased secretions are often seen with ketamine use

#### Central Nervous System
- Increases cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow thereby increasing cerebral vasodilation 
- Ketamine has a profound cataleptic state where akinesia is present however consciousness is not impaired, this can lead to a dissociative state where patients may have unpleasant dreams, hallucinations or frank delirium 
- Anticonvulsant properties  
- Increased tone which can manifest as myoclonic contraction and vocalization 

## Indications [^3]
#### Anesthetic Indications
- Induction of general anesthesia 
- Short term sedation and analgesia during procedures or other clinical indications 

#### Other Indications 
- Bronchodilatory properties for patients with bronchospasm
- Treatment of refractory depression and suicidal ideation 
- Widely used in the emergency department in short cases requiring short term anesthetic, such as fracture reductions 
- Pain management 

## Dosage [^2]
- Induction doses are 0.5 - 2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM 
- Maintenance doses are 2 - 6 mg/kg/h
- Analgesia doses are 0.15 - 0.25 mg/kg IV
- Half-life of redistribution = 11 - 16 minutes
- Half-life of elimination = 2 - 4 hours

## Complications  [^2] [^3]
- Most commonly, patients can experience nausea, vomiting, dysphoria, drowsiness and confusion 
- Delirium and hallucinations can occur due to cataleptic state, especially in older adults
- Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis
- Increased muscular tone with myoclonic contractions resembling seizures 
- It should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms due to ketamine's stimulatory effects on the sympathetic nervous system
